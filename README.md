# Group Chat Story Generator


## Project Description
The Group Chat Story Generator is a Python-based project designed to automatically generate stories or summaries from group chat data. Using state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) models, specifically the Pegasus model from the Hugging Face transformers library, this tool can process a CSV file containing group chat messages and transform the conversational data into coherent, summarized text. This project is ideal for creating narrative stories or concise summaries from lengthy chat logs.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: The project includes scripts for preprocessing group chat data, including cleaning, formatting, and preparing it for input to the Pegasus model.
- **Model Fine-Tuning**: Utilizes the Hugging Face Transformers library to fine-tune the Pegasus model on custom group chat data.
- **Story Generation**: Once the model is trained, it can generate stories based on input group chat conversations.
- **Evaluation**: Provides methods for evaluating the generated stories, including metrics such as coherence, fluency, and relevance.

## Getting Started on Google Colab 
  1. **Open the Notebook in Google Colab**
     You can run the project directly in Google Colab by opening the notebook from your GitHub repository.If the notebook is stored locally, upload it to Colab by selecting File > Upload notebook.
  
  2.**Install Required Dependencies**
    Run the following command in a Colab code cell to install the necessary libraries:
   ```bash
  !pip install transformers[sentencepiece] datasets sacrebleu rouge_score py7zr -q
  ```
  3.**Mount Google Drive (Optional)**
    If your group chat data is stored on Google Drive, mount your Drive in Colab:
  ```bash
  from google.colab import drive
  drive.mount('/content/drive')
  ```
  4.**Upload Your Data**
    You can either upload your group chat CSV file directly to the Colab environment or access     it from Google Drive.
  
  5.**Run the Notebook**
  Follow the instructions in the notebook to load your data, configure the Pegasus model, and     generate summaries or stories.

## Example Output
Below is an example of a summarized story generated from group chat data:
## Original Chat:
[User1]: Hey, how's everyone doing today?
[User2]: I'm good, just finished a project.
[User3]: Same here, feeling productive.
...

## Generated Summary:
The group discussed their productivity and recent accomplishments, with everyone feeling positive about their day.
