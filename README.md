# GroupChatStoryGen

## Overview
GroupChatStoryGen is a groundbreaking project harnessing the power of Google's Pegasus model to craft captivating narratives from group chat discussions. Pegasus, renowned for its prowess in abstractive text summarization, has been fine-tuned specifically for this purpose, enriching the storytelling experience. 

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: The project includes scripts for preprocessing group chat data, including cleaning, formatting, and preparing it for input to the Pegasus model.
- **Model Fine-Tuning**: Utilizes the Hugging Face Transformers library to fine-tune the Pegasus model on custom group chat data.
- **Story Generation**: Once the model is trained, it can generate stories based on input group chat conversations.
- **Evaluation**: Provides methods for evaluating the generated stories, including metrics such as coherence, fluency, and relevance.
